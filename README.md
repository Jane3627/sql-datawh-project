# 🧠 SQL Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to my **SQL Server Data Warehouse & Analytics Portfolio Project**!  
This end-to-end solution showcases how to build a modern data warehouse using SQL Server, implement ETL workflows, design analytical data models, and extract business insights through SQL-based reporting.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture Overview

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** pattern, organizing data into three structured layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from ERP and CRM systems via CSV files into SQL Server.
- **Silver Layer**: Data cleansing, transformation, and normalization to ensure consistency and usability.
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data modeled into a star schema for efficient reporting and analytics.
